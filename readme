Small stuff I think may be useful.

- pastebin.py
 	Simple script to post a file to pastebin.
	Use - as filename for stdin.

- extract
	Shell script to extract archive to corresponding folder
	e.g extract abc.zip will extract to folder ./abc
	Can also specify a specific directory instead as second parameter
	supports zip, rar, tar.gz, tgz, tar.bz
	I'll add more if and when I need them :P
